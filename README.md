## WSU-Map

This is a map of the Winona State campus that has a hand mapped graph of nodes placed on it. The graph can be used to find the shortest path between classes or for any other reason.   
  
The program is general enough to be used with any top down map, and nodes can be added and edited very easily. The map can be panned and zoomed, and additionally all colors can be adjust with the right hamburger panel.
